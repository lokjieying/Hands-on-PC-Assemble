## 💡 Reflection
Through the PC Assemble lab, I learned how to identify the main hardware components such as the motherboard, CPU, RAM, power supply and storage devices. I also gained hands-on experience in assembling the components step by step, which enhanced my understanding of computer hardware. All in all, this activity improved my technical skills and increased my confidence in assembling a computer.
